# Persistent_Hodge_Laplacian
Persistent_Hodge_Laplacian is a matlab code to compute the eig value of persistent combinatorial Laplacian matrix.

The project includes two folders: C60 and Ligand/Protein interaction. Each folder contains: the main code Hodge_Laplacian.m, computeVRcomplex.m to compute VR complex, pdb2mat.m to read pdb data. 
Please refer to C60_Hodge_Laplacian.m/LP_Hodge_Laplacian_Norm.m for the usage

The L/P pdb file can be obtained from PDBbind-CN database www.pdbbind.org.cn
