# Hodge_Laplacian
Hodge_Laplacian is a matlab code to compute the eig value of combinatorial Laplacian matrix.
The project includes two folders: C60 and Ligand/Protein interaction
C60 can read C60 pdb file and generate the corresponding eig values; refer to C60_Hodge_Laplacian.m
Ligand/Protein interaction can read ligand/protein pdb files and generate interactive eig values; refer to LP_Hodge_Laplacian_Norm.m
